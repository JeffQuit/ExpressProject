To install this application, first fork and clone the github repo. Once the repo is on your local machine, you can start the server by running the "node server.js" command. This will initilize the
server on PORT 3004 on your local machine. From here, you can open up the application using the local host URL http://localhost:3004/

## Usage

To use this application, either host the application on a server or on your local machine after running the "node server.js" command. Then, click the ADD NOTE button. Once on the /notes page you can
add a new note and save it using the save icon. Once saved, the new note will appear in the right hand side of the /notes page. You can also delete the note by using the trashcan icon next to the
specific note.
